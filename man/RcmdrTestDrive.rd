\details{
  The R Commander has extensive functionality, but many options are unavailable
  unless the correct types of data are loaded in the Active Data Set.  This
  data set was randomly generated so that, when loaded, essentially all R Commander
  options would be available for the student to investigate.  These data are
  entirely fictional.  For an amusing contributed story tying these variables together,
  please visit \url{http://www.cc.ysu.edu/~gjkerns/IPSUR/package}.
