# IPSUR: Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R

Copyright (C) 2022 G. Jay Kerns

Version 3.0

This package is the source code to generate `IPSUR`, a free textbook on Probability and Statistics.  

## Install

Until the package is resubmited on CRAN, the easiest/quickest way to get `IPSUR` (which at the moment doesn't do what it is supposed to do) is to install the `devtools` package if you don't have it already and run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/IPSUR")
```

You will get lots of errs due to missing dependencies.  See the file `renv.lock` to understand which packages you need to run `IPSUR`---there are quite a few.
