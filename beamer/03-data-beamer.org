* Types of Data

datum: any piece of information

data set: collection of data related to each other somehow 

- Categories of Data
  - quantitative: associated with a measurement of some quantity 
    on an observational unit,
  - qualitative: associated with some quality or property of the 
    observational unit,
  - logical: represents true/false, important later
  - missing: should be there but aren't
  - other types: everything else



* Quantitative Data

Quantitative data: any that measure the quantity of something

- invariably assume numerical values

- can be further subdivided: 

  - Discrete data take values in a finite or countably infinite 
    set of numbers

  - Continuous data take values in an interval of numbers. AKA 
    scale, interval, measurement

- distinction between discrete and continuous data not always 
  clear-cut



* 

Example
Annual Precipitation in US Cities. (precip) avg amount rainfall 
(in.) for 70 cities in US and Puerto Rico.

<<>>=

str(precip)

precip[1:4]

@


Second block, here
quantitative, continuous



* 

Example
Lengths of Major North American Rivers. =rivers= lengths (mi) of 
rivers in North America. See ?rivers.

<<>>=

str(rivers)

rivers[1:4]

@



* 

Yearly Numbers of Important Discoveries. =discoveries= numbers of
"great" inventions/discoveries in each year from 1860 to 1959 (from
1975 World Almanac)

<<>>=

str(discoveries)

discoveries[1:4]

@

* Displaying Quantitative Data

- Strip charts (or Dot plots): 
  - for either discrete or continuous data 
  - usually best when data not too large. 

Second block here

- the stripchart function
  - three methods:
    - =overplot= - only distinct values
    - =jitter= - add noise in y direction
    - =stack= - repeats on top of one another




* 

<<eval = FALSE>>=

stripchart(precip, xlab="rainfall")

stripchart(rivers, method="jitter", xlab="length")

stripchart(discoveries, method="stack", xlab="number")

@



* 

[float Figure:
<<echo = FALSE, fig = TRUE, width = 4.5, height = 2.75>>=
par(cex = 0.5)

par(cex = 0.5)
stripchart(discoveries, method="stack", xlab="number")
@

[Figure 3:
Stripchart of discoveries
]


]



* Histograms

- Histograms
  - typically for continuous data
  - decide on bins/classes, make bars proportional to membership
  - often misidentified (bar graphs)

<<eval = FALSE>>=

hist(precip, main = "")

hist(precip, freq = FALSE, main = "")

@



* 

[float Figure:
<<echo = FALSE, fig=true, height = 3, width = 3.5>>=
par(mfrow = c(1,2), cex = 0.4)
hist(precip, main = "")
hist(precip, freq = FALSE, main = "")
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
@

[Figure 4:
Histograms of precip
]


]


* Remarks about histograms

- choose different bins, get a different histogram
- many algorithms for choosing bins automatically
- should investigate several bin choices
  - look for stability
  - try to capture underlying story of data


* Stemplots

- Stemplots have two basic parts: stems and leaves
  - initial digit(s) taken for stem
  - trailing digits stand for leaves
  - leaves accumulate to the right

Example 

Road Casualties in Great Britain 1969-84. A time series of
total car drivers killed or seriously injured in Great Britain monthly
from Jan 1969 to Dec 1984.



* Stemplot of UK Driver Deaths

<<eval = FALSE>>=
library(aplpack)
stem.leaf(UKDriverDeaths, depth = FALSE)
@



<<echo = FALSE>>=
library(aplpack)
stem.leaf(UKDriverDeaths, depth = FALSE)
@




* Code for stemplots


<<>>=

UKDriverDeaths[1:4]

stem.leaf(UKDriverDeaths, depth = FALSE)

@



* Index Plots

Good for plotting data ordered in time

- a 2-D plot, with index (observation number) on x-axis, value on
  y-axis

- two methods
  - spikes: draws vertical line up to value (type = "h")
  - points: simple dot at the observed height (type = "p")

Second block here 
Example 
Level of Lake Huron 1875-1972. annual measurements of the level (in
feet) of Lake Huron from 1875--1972.


* 

[float Figure:
<<echo = FALSE, fig=true, height = 2.75, width = 3.5>>=
par(mfrow = c(2,1), cex = 0.4)
plot(LakeHuron, type = "h")
plot(LakeHuron, type = "p")
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
@

[Figure 5:
Index plots of LakeHuron
]


]



* Qualitative Data, Categorical Data, Factors

- Qualitative data: any data that are not numerical, or do not 
  represent numerical quantities
  - some data look quantitative. Example: shoe size
  - some data identify the observation, not of much interest
- Factors subdivide data into categories 
  - possible values of a factor: levels 
  - factors may be nominal or ordinal 
    - nominal: levels are names, only (gender, political party, 
      ethnicity)
    - ordinal: levels are ordered (SES, class rank, shoe size)



* 

Example:
U.S. State Facts and Features. postal abbreviations

<<>>=
str(state.abb)
@


Example
U.S. State Facts and Features. The region in which a state 
resides

<<>>=
state.region[1:4]
@



* Qualitative Data

- Factors have special status in R
  - represented internally by numbers, but not always printed that way
  - constructed with =factor= command
- Displaying Qualitative Data
  - first try: make a (contingency) table with =table= function
  - =prop.table= makes a relative frequency table

Example
U.S. State Facts and Features. State division



* Displaying Qualitative Data


<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
Tbl <- table(state.division)
Tbl               # frequencies
@




* Displaying Qualitative Data



<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
Tbl/sum(Tbl)      # relative frequencies
@


* Displaying Qualitative Data

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
prop.table(Tbl)   # same thing
@



* Bar Graphs
- discrete analogue of the histogram
- make bar for each level of a factor
- may show frequencies or relative frequencies
- impression given depends on order of bars (default: alphabetical)

Example
U.S. State Facts and Features. State region

<<eval = FALSE>>=
barplot(table(state.region))
barplot(prop.table(table(state.region)))
@



* 

[float Figure:
<<echo = FALSE, fig=true, height = 2.75, width = 4.5>>=
par(mfrow = c(1,2), cex = 0.5) # 2 plots: 1 row, 2 columns
barplot(table(state.region))
barplot(prop.table(table(state.region)))
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
@

[Figure 6:
(Relative) frequency bar graphs of state.region
]
]


* Pareto Diagram

- a bar graph with ordered bars
- bar with highest (relative) frequency goes on left
- bars drop from left to right
- can sometimes help discern hidden structure

Example
U.S. State Facts and Features. State division

<<eval = FALSE>>=
library(qcc)
pareto.chart(table(state.division), ylab="Frequency")
@


* 



[float Figure:
<<echo = FALSE, results = hide, fig=true, height =2.75, width = 
4.5>>=
par(cex.axis=0.5, mex=0.5,  cex.main=0.5)
library(qcc)
pareto.chart(table(state.division), ylab="Frequency", col="gray")
@

[Figure 7:
Pareto diagram of state.division
]
]



* Dot Charts

- a bar graph on its side
- has dots instead of bars
- can show complicated multivariate relationships

Example
U.S. State Facts and Features. State region

<<eval = FALSE>>=
x <- table(state.region)
dotchart(as.vector(x), labels = names(x))
@



* 

[float Figure:
<<echo = FALSE, results = hide, fig=true, height = 2.75, width = 
4.5>>=
par(cex=0.5)
x <- table(state.region)
dotchart(as.vector(x), labels = names(x))
@

[Figure 8:
Dot chart of state.region
]
]


* Other Data Types

- Logical
  <<>>=
  x <- 5:9
  y <- (x < 7.3)
  y
  !y
  @

- Missing



* Other Data Types

- Missing: represented by =NA=
  <<>>=
  x <- c(3, 7, NA, 4, 7)
  y <- c(5, NA, 1, 2, 2)
  x + y
  @

- Some functions have =na.rm= argument
  <<>>=
  is.na(x)
  z <- x[!is.na(x)]
  sum(z)
  @


* Features of Data Distributions

Four Basic Features
1. Center: middle or general tendency
2. Spread: small means tightly clustered, large means highly variable
3. Shape: symmetry versus skewness, kurtosis
4. Unusual Features: anything else that pops out at you about the data



* More about shape

Symmetry versus Skewness
- symmetric
- right (positive) and left (negative) skewness
Kurtosis
- leptokurtic - steep peak, heavy tails
- platykurtic - flatter, thin tails
- mesokurtic - right in the middle



* Unusual features: clusters and gaps

<<eval = FALSE>>=
stem.leaf(faithful$eruptions)
@



<<echo = FALSE>>=
library(aplpack)
stem.leaf(faithful$eruptions)
@




* Unusual features: extreme observations

- Extreme observation: falls far from the rest of the data
  - possible sources
    - could be typo
    - could be in wrong study
    - could be indicative of something deeper
- Quantitatively measure features: Descriptive Statistics
  - qualitative data: frequencies or relative frequencies
  - quantitative data: measures of CUSS



* Measures of center: sample mean x (read "x-bar"):


\[
\overline{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.
\]

- Good: natural, easy to compute, nice properties
- Bad: sensitive to extreme values

How to do it with R

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
stack.loss    # built-in data
mean(stack.loss)
@



* Measures of center: sample median \tilde{x}:

How to find it

1. sort the data into an increasing sequence of $n$ numbers 
2. $\tilde{x}$ lies in position $(n+1)/2$
- Good: resistant to extreme values, easy to describe
- Bad: not as mathematically tractable, need to sort the data to 
  calculate

How to do it with R

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
median(stack.loss)
@



* Measures of center: trimmed mean \(\overline{x}_{t}\):

How to find it
1. "trim" a proportion of data from both ends of the ordered list
2. find the sample mean of what's left
   - Good: also resistant to extreme values, has good properties, too
   - Bad: still need to sort data to get rid of outliers

How to do it with R

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
mean(stack.loss, trim = 0.05)
@

* Order Statistics


Given data \(x_{1}, x_{2}, ...,x_{n}\), sort in an increasing 
sequence
\[
x_{(1)}\leq x_{(2)}\leq x_{(3)}\leq\cdots\leq x_{(n)}
\]

- \(x_{(k)}\) is the \(k^{\mathrm{th}}\) order statistic
- approx \(100(k/n)\%\) of the observations fall below \(x_{(k)}\)


How to do it with R

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
sort(stack.loss)
@


* Sample quantile, order /p/, \((0 \leq p \leq 1)\), denoted \(\tilde{q}_p\)


We describe the default (type = 7)
1. get the order statistics \(x_{(1)}, x_{(2)}, ...,x_{(n)}\).
2. calculate \((n - 1)p + 1\) , write in form \(k.d\), with \(k\) an
   integer and \(d\) a decimal
3. \( \tilde{q}_{p}=x_{(k)}+d(x_{(k+1)}-x_{(k)}) \).
   - approximately \(100p\%\) of the data fall below the value \(\tilde{q}_{p}\)

How to do it with R

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
quantile(stack.loss, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.37))
@


* Measures of spread: sample variance, std. deviation

The sample variance \(s^{2}\)
\[
s^{2}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\xbar)^{2}
\]

The sample standard deviation is $s = \sqrt{s^{2}}$. 
- Good: tractable, nice mathematical/statistical properties
- Bad: sensitive to extreme values

How to do it with R

<<keep.source = TRUE>>=
var(stack.loss); sd(stack.loss)
@



* Interpretation of /s/

- Chebychev's Rule The proportion of observations within k standard
  deviations of the mean is at least $1-1/k^{2}$, i.e., at least 75%,
  89%, and 94% of the data are within 2, 3, and 4 standard deviations
  of the mean, respectively.
- Empirical Rule: If data follow a bell-shaped curve, then
  approximately 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the data are within 1, 2, and 3
  standard deviations of the mean, respectively.




* Measures of spread: interquartile range
The /Interquartile range/ IQR

\[
IQR=\tilde{q}_{0.75}-\tilde{q}_{0.25}
\]

- Good: resistant to outliers
- Bad: only considers middle 50% of the data

How to do it with R

<<>>=
IQR(stack.loss)
@


* Measures of spread: median absolute deviation


The /median absolute deviation/ MAD:

1. get the order statistics, find the median $\tilde{x}$.

2. calculate the absolute deviations:
   \[
   \left|x_{1}-\tilde{x}\right|,\ \left|x_{2}-\tilde{x}\right|,\ \ldots,\left|x_{n}-\tilde{x}\right|
   \]
3. the $MAD \propto \mbox{median}\left\{ \left|x_{1}-\tilde{x}\right|,\ \left|x_{2}-\tilde{x}\right|,\ \ldots,\left|x_{n}-\tilde{x}\right|\right\}$ 


- Good: excellently robust
- Bad: not as popular, not as intuitive

How to do it with R

<<>>=
mad(stack.loss)
@



* Measures of spread: the range

The /range/ $R$:

\[
R=x_{(n)}-x_{(1)}
\]

- Good (not so much): easy to describe and calculate 
- Bad: ignores everything but the most extreme observations

How to do it with R

<<>>=
range(stack.loss)
diff(range(stack.loss))
@



* Measures of shape: sample skewness

The sample skewness $g_{1}$:
\[
g_{1}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\xbar)^{3}}{s^{3}}.
\]

Things to notice:
- invariant w.r.t. location and scale
- $-\infty<g_{1}<\infty$
- sign of $g_{1}$  indicates direction of skewness ($\pm$)

How to do it with R

<<>>=
library(e1071)
skewness(stack.loss)
@



* Measures of shape: sample skewness

How big is BIG? 
\[
4.34\ \mbox{versus }0.434??
\]

Rule of thumb:
If $|g_{1}| > 2\sqrt{6/n}$, then the data distribution is
substantially skewed (in the direction of the sign of $g_{1}$).

<<>>=
skewness(discoveries)
2*sqrt(6/length(discoveries))
@



* Measures of shape: sample excess kurtosis

The sample excess kurtosis $g_{2}$:
\[
g_{2}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\xbar)^{4}}{s^{4}}-3.
\]

Things to note:
- invariant w.r.t. location and scale
- $-2 \leq g_{2} < \infty$
- $g_{2} > 0$ indicates leptokurtosis, $g_{2} < 0$ indicates platykurtosis

How to do it with R

<<>>=
library(e1071)
kurtosis(stack.loss)
@




* Measures of shape: sample excess kurtosis

Again, how big is BIG? 


Rule of thumb:
If $|g_{2}| > 4\sqrt{6/n}$, then the data distribution is
substantially kurtic.

<<>>=
kurtosis(UKDriverDeaths)
4*sqrt(6/length(UKDriverDeaths))
@


* Exploratory data analysis: more on stemplots
- Trim Outliers: observations that fall far from the bulk of the other
  data often obscure structure to the data and are best left out. Use
  the =trim.outliers= argument to =stem.leaf=.
- Split Stems: we sometimes fix "skyscraper" stemplots by increasing
  the number of lines available for a given stem. The end result is a
  more spread out stemplot which often looks better. Use the =m=
  argument to =stem.leaf=
- Depths: give insight into balance of the data around the
  median. Frequencies are accumulated from the outside inward,
  including outliers. Use =depths = TRUE=.

<<eval = FALSE>>=
stem.leaf(faithful$eruptions)
@

* Exploratory data analysis: more on stemplots

<<echo = FALSE>>=
stem.leaf(faithful$eruptions)
@


* Hinges and the 5NS

- Find the order statistics $x_{(1)}, x_{(2)}, ..., x_{(n)}$. 
- The lower hinge $h_{L}$ is in position $L=\left\lfloor
  (n+3)/2\right\rfloor /2$
- The upper hinge $h_{U}$ is in position $n + 1 - L$.

Given the hinges, the five number summary (5NS) is 
\[
5NS=(x_{(1)},\ h_{L},\ \tilde{x},\ h_{U},\ x_{(n)}).
\]

How to do it with R

<<>>=
fivenum(stack.loss)
@

* Boxplots

Boxplot: a visual display of the 5NS. Can visually assess multiple
features of the data set:

- Center: estimated by the sample median, \tilde{x}
- Spread: judged by the width of the box, h_{U}-h_{L}
- Shape: indicated by the relative lengths of the whiskers, position
  of the median inside box.
- Extreme observations: identified by open circles

How to do it with R

<<eval = FALSE>>=
boxplot(rivers, horizontal = TRUE)
@


* Outliers
- potential: falls beyond 1.5 times the width of the box
  \[
  \mbox{less than }h_{L}-1.5(h_{U}-h_{L})\mbox{ or greater than }h_{U}+1.5(h_{U}-h_{L})
  \]
- suspected: falls beyond 3 times the width of the box
  \[
  \mbox{less than }h_{L}-3(h_{U}-h_{L})\mbox{ or greater than }h_{U}+3(h_{U}-h_{L})
  \]


How to do it with R

* Standardizing variables

- useful to see how observation relates to other observations
- AKA measure of relative standing, z-score
  \[
  z_{i}=\frac{x_{i}-\xbar}{s},\quad i=1,2,\ldots,n
  \]
- unitless
- positive (negative) z-score falls above (below) mean

How to do it with R

<<>>=
scale(precip)[1:3]
@

* Multivariate data: data frames

- usually have two (or more) measurements associated with each subject
- display in rectangular array
  - each row corresponds to a subject
  - columns contain the measurements for each variable

How to do it with R

<<keep.source=TRUE>>=
x <- 5:6;  y <- letters[3:4]; z <- c(0.1, 3.8)
data.frame(v1 = x, v2 = y, v3 = z)
@



* More on data frames

- must have same number of rows in each column
- all measurements in single column must be same type
- indexing is two-dimensional; the columns have names

How to do it with R

<<keep.source=TRUE>>=
A <- data.frame(v1 = x, v2 = y, v3 = z)
A[2, 1];  A[1,];  A[, 3]
@



* Bivariate data: qualitative versus qualitative

Two categorical variables
- usually make a two-way contingency table 
- in the R Commander with Statistics $\triangleright$ Contingency

data(RcmdrTestDrive)
xtabs(~ gender + smoking, data = RcmdrTestDrive)
@



* Bivariate data: more on tables

- Descriptive statistics: for now, marginal totals/percentages
- more to talk about later: odds ratio, relative risk

How to do it with R

* Measuring Linear association


The sample Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient:
\[
r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\xbar)(y_{i}-\ybar)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\xbar)}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\ybar)}}
\]

- independent of scale
- $-1\leq r\leq1$, equality when points lie on straight line 


How to do it with R

<<>>=
with(iris, cor(Petal.Width, Petal.Length))
with(attenu, cor(dist, accel))
@



* More about linear correlation

- measures strength and direction of linear association
- Rules of thumb:
  - $0 < \vert r \vert <0.3$, weak linear association
  - $0.3 < \vert r \vert < 0.7$, moderate linear association
  - $0.7 < \vert r \vert < 1$, strong linear association
- Just because $r \approx 0$ doesn't mean there isn't any association

* One quantitative, one categorical

- Break down quantitative var by groups of subjects
  - compare centers and spreads: variation within versus between
    groups
  - compare clusters and gaps
  - compare outliers and unusual features
  - compare shapes.
- graphical and numerical

* Comparison of groups

How to do it with R

<<eval = FALSE>>=
stripchart(weight ~ feed, method="stack", data=chickwts)
library(lattice)
histogram(~age | education, data = infert)
bwplot(~count | spray, data = InsectSprays)
@

<<echo = FALSE, results = hide, fig=true, height = 2.75, width = 
4.5>>=
par(cex=0.4)
stripchart(weight ~ feed, method="stack", data=chickwts)

* Multiple variables


With more variables, complexity increases

- multi-way contingency tables (bunch of categorical vars)
  - mosaic plots, dotcharts
- sample variance-covariance matrices
  - scatterplot matrices
- comparing groups: coplots

How to do it with R

<<eval = FALSE>>=
splom(~cbind(Murder, Assault, Rape), data = USArrests)
?dotchart; ?xyplot;  ?mosaicplot
@
