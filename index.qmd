Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R is a textbook written for an undergraduate course in probability and statistics. IPSUR is FREE, in the GNU sense of the word.

## Install

This package is distributed via GitHub, and not CRAN. Here are the steps to install `IPSUR` on your own system.

### CRAN dependencies

First install the `CRAN` packages that are referenced in `IPSUR`. Launch `R` and type the following at the command prompt "\>":


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("actuar", "aplpack", "binom", "boot", "coin", "diagram",
                   "distrEx", "e1071", "emdbook", "ggplot2", "HH", "Hmisc",
                   "lmtest", "mvtnorm", "qcc", "reshape", "RcmdrMisc",
                   "scatterplot3d", "TeachingDemos", "vcd"))
```

There should be a lot of packages installed at this step.

### Other dependencies

You will need the `devtools` package to install the `prob` package from GitHub.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("combinat")  # the prob package depends on combinat
install.packages("devtools")  # if you don't have it already
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/prob")
```

and then install `IPSUR` with 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/IPSUR")
```


## Load

Once IPSUR is downloaded and installed, it must be loaded into R. Load the package with the `library` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(IPSUR)
```

and finally launch your PDF viewer with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read(IPSUR)
```

## Develop

IPSUR development is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gjkerns/IPSUR).
