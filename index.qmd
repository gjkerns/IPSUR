IPSUR is FREE, in the GNU sense of the word.

## Install

This package is distributed via GitHub, and not CRAN.  You will need the `devtools` package to install `IPSUR`,  Launch `R` and type the following at the command prompt "\>":

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")  # if you don't have it already
```

and then install `IPSUR` with 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/prob")
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/IPSUR")
```

You will run into lots of errors because of missing dependencies.  See the file `renv.lock` for info on packages to install.  These packages are important because they are used in the `IPSUR` narrative.

## Load

Once IPSUR is downloaded and installed, it must be loaded into R. Load the package with the library function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(IPSUR)
```

and finally launch your PDF viewer with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read(IPSUR)
```

## Develop

IPSUR development is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gjkerns/IPSUR).
